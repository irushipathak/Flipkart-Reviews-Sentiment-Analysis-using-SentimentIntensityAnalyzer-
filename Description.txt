Flipkart Product Reviews — Sentiment Analysis

Executive Summary
-----------------
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis of Flipkart product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
The goal is to automatically identify customer opinions expressed in product reviews and classify them as positive or negative.

The workflow combines text preprocessing, rule-based sentiment scoring using NLTK’s VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), 
and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier trained on processed text features. 
The system evaluates performance using accuracy and F1-score and visualizes results with a confusion matrix.

This approach provides businesses with actionable insights into customer satisfaction and product perception, 
enabling better decision-making for product improvements, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

Detailed Technical Description
-------------------------------
This project implements a baseline sentiment analysis pipeline for Flipkart product reviews. 
The dataset (FlipkartData.csv) contains reviews, ratings, and sentiments, which are processed through the following steps:

1. Data Cleaning
   - Removed unnecessary columns (product_name, product_price, Rate, etc.).
   - Handled missing values in the Summary column.
   - Normalized sentiment labels into binary form (positive vs negative).

2. Text Preprocessing
   - Converted text to lowercase.
   - Removed special characters and non-alphabetic tokens.
   - Applied stopword removal while preserving negations like 'not', 'don’t', and 'isn’t'.
   - Performed stemming using Porter Stemmer.

3. Sentiment Scoring with VADER
   - Used NLTK’s SentimentIntensityAnalyzer to compute pos, neg, neu, and compound scores for each review.
   - These provide interpretable sentiment signals.

4. Feature Extraction
   - Transformed cleaned text into numerical features using CountVectorizer with unigrams and bigrams (ngram_range=(1,2)).
   - Limited vocabulary size (max_features=3000) to balance accuracy and memory usage.

5. Model Training
   - Trained a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on the vectorized features.
   - Used train_test_split with stratification to maintain class balance.

6. Evaluation
   - Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Displayed results using a classification report and a confusion matrix heatmap.
   - Saved the augmented dataset with cleaned text and VADER scores as flipkart_with_vader_and_clean.csv.

Conclusion
----------
This system establishes a baseline for product review sentiment analysis. 
It demonstrates how rule-based methods (VADER) and machine learning classifiers can be combined to gain insights into customer feedback. 
Future improvements include adding a neutral class, experimenting with TF-IDF features, and extending to deep learning models (LSTM, BERT) for higher accuracy.
